                    <h3>About Me</h3>
                    <p>A large part of my interest in software development comes from my experience as a researcher collaborating with the numerous roles required for a successful study.</p>
                    <p>Working with data as a research coordinator from fields such as the neuroscience of language to chronic illness and clinical psychiatry, I'm passionate about how software development can break barriers to potentially life-saving discoveries!</p>
                    <p>Part of that passion means I believe in:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating easily digestable and future-proofed code</li>
                        <li>Producing clear, concise, and communicable datasets</li>
                        <li>The principle that quality works starts with quality collaboration</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>My Journey</h3>
                    <p>After receiving my B.A. in psychology and biology, I worked for a variety of research institutes: local labs, university research centers, and state-of-the-art research hostpitals.</p>
                    <p>It was through my work as a research coordinator I came to see the power of modernizing research practices through coding.</p>
                    <p>I'm excited to pursue this new endeavor through Thinkful's software engineering bootcamp and continue working with the teams I was once part of!</p>
